# Event Engine ACAP

An IFTTT-style rule engine for Axis cameras that replaces and extends the built-in event system. Build automation rules with multiple triggers, conditions, and actions - including MQTT, HTTP webhooks, scheduling, recording, PTZ, overlays, variables, counters, and more.

## Features

- **Rules** - multiple triggers (OR/AND logic), multiple conditions, multiple actions per rule
- **Triggers** - VAPIX event, HTTP webhook, MQTT message, schedule (cron/interval/daily), I/O input, counter threshold, rule chaining
- **Conditions** - time window, event state, counter comparison, HTTP check, I/O state, variable compare
- **Actions** - HTTP request, recording start/stop, overlay text, PTZ preset, I/O output, audio clip, syslog, VAPIX event, delay, set variable, increment counter, MQTT publish, run rule
- **MQTT** - full MQTT 3.1.1 client (raw sockets, no external library), QoS 0 and QoS 1 publish, wildcard topic subscriptions, reconnect with backoff. Password stored separately and never exposed via the API
- **Templates** - `{{timestamp}}`, `{{camera.serial}}`, `{{trigger.KEY}}`, `{{var.NAME}}`, `{{counter.NAME}}` in action payloads. The editor shows which `{{trigger.*}}` keys are available based on the rule's triggers
- **Camera-aware UI** - VAPIX event trigger shows a dropdown of events fetched from the camera; PTZ preset action lists the camera's configured presets; audio clip action lists available media clips
- **Scheduler** - cron expressions, fixed intervals, daily time with day-of-week selection
- **Variables & Counters** - named, persistent, usable in templates and conditions
- **Event Log** - per-rule history with result codes
- **Web UI** - dark-theme interface with rule editor, event log, variables, MQTT config, and status
- **API Docs** - OpenAPI 3.0 spec with Swagger UI at `/swagger.html`
- **Export/Import** - backup and restore rules and settings as JSON

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - for cross-compilation
- [ACAP Native SDK 12.0.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/axisecp/acap-native-sdk) - pulled automatically by the build
- Axis camera running AXIS OS 11.x or later

## Build

```bash
./build.sh
```

Produces two installable packages:
- `Event_Engine_1_0_0_aarch64.eap` - for cameras with Cortex-A53+ (most cameras from ~2017+)
- `Event_Engine_1_0_0_armv7hf.eap` - for older cameras with Cortex-A9

## Install

1. Open your camera's web interface: `http://<camera-ip>/#settings/apps`
2. Click **Add app** and upload the `.eap` file matching your camera's architecture
3. Start the application

The UI is accessible at:
```
http://<camera-ip>/local/acap_event_engine/index.html
```

## API

All endpoints are under `/local/acap_event_engine/` and require HTTP Basic Auth with admin credentials.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET/POST/DELETE | `/rules` | Rule CRUD - POST without `id` creates, POST with `?id=` updates |
| POST | `/fire` | Fire a rule manually or via webhook token |
| GET | `/triggers` | Available trigger types |
| GET | `/actions` | Available action types |
| GET/POST/DELETE | `/variables` | Variables and counters |
| GET | `/events` | Event log |
| GET | `/engine` | Engine status, MQTT status, device info |
| GET/POST | `/settings` | Engine and MQTT configuration |

Full OpenAPI spec: `app/html/openapi.json`
Interactive docs: `http://<camera-ip>/local/acap_event_engine/swagger.html`

### Webhook

Trigger rules from any external system:

```bash
curl -u admin:pass -X POST \
  "http://<camera-ip>/local/acap_event_engine/fire" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"token": "my-secret-token", "payload": {"source": "doorbell"}}'
```

### Templates

Action fields (URL, body, message, MQTT payload, etc.) support `{{...}}` substitution:

```json
{
  "type": "http_request",
  "url": "https://example.com/notify",
  "body": "{\"camera\": \"{{camera.serial}}\", \"time\": \"{{timestamp}}\", \"zone\": \"{{trigger.source}}\"}"
}
```

| Token | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `{{timestamp}}` | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp |
| `{{date}}` | YYYY-MM-DD |
| `{{time}}` | HH:MM:SS |
| `{{camera.serial}}` | Camera serial number |
| `{{camera.model}}` | Camera model |
| `{{camera.ip}}` | Camera IP address |
| `{{trigger.KEY}}` | Any key from the trigger event data |
| `{{var.NAME}}` | Named variable value |
| `{{counter.NAME}}` | Named counter value |

## Notes

- **Overlay text** uses the VAPIX Dynamic Overlay API (`addText`/`setText`). The overlay is created on first use and reused on subsequent firings. Set a duration to auto-remove it after N seconds, or 0 to keep it permanently. Position and text colour are configurable per action.
- **MQTT payload filter** - `mqtt_message` triggers can optionally match only messages whose payload contains a specific substring.
- **VAPIX event trigger data** - event data keys (e.g. `active`, `source`) are flattened into trigger data so they are directly usable as `{{trigger.active}}` etc. in action templates.
- **PTZ presets** - the PTZ preset action fetches the camera's configured presets at page load and shows them in a grouped dropdown (by channel). Falls back to a text field on cameras without PTZ.
- **Audio clips** - the audio clip action lists available media clips from the camera (`MediaClip` parameter group). Plays via `mediaclip.cgi?action=play&clip=<id>`.
- **Rule duplication** - click the ⎘ button on any rule card to open a copy in the editor.
- **Corrupt rules.json** - if the rules file cannot be parsed on startup, the engine logs a warning, sets a status flag, and falls back to the bundled default rules.

## Persistence

Rules and settings are stored in the camera's `localdata/` directory and persist across application updates (in-place upgrades). To preserve data across a full uninstall/reinstall, use the **Export** buttons in the Status tab to download your rules and settings as JSON before uninstalling.
